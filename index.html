  <h1>Starting Light Universal Constitution</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Wai Yan Mg</p>

  <h2>Preamble</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>In this universe, there is the Truth.</strong><br>
    A truth beyond borders, beliefs, and forms — a truth that connects all life.</p>

    <p>We, the beings of Earth and beyond, recognize that we are not owners of the world,<br>
    but caretakers of its balance, stewards of its harmony, and witnesses of its unfolding truth.</p>

    <p>We gather not in conquest or control, but in humility and hope,<br>
    to declare a universal path for peace, protection, and shared responsibility —<br>
    a light to guide all generations, in all places, across <strong>time, space, and limitless possibility</strong>.</p>

    <p>In this journey, we honor not only the wisdom of traditions,<br>
    but also the discoveries of science — as both reason and wonder lead us<br>
    toward the greater truths that unite all life.</p>

    <p><strong>Under the truth of peace,</strong> we renounce all violence and division.<br>
    <strong>Under the truth of justice,</strong> we commit to fairness, dignity, and protection for all beings.<br>
    <strong>Under the truth of respect,</strong> we honor every life — human, animal, plant, and unseen.<br>
    <strong>Under the truth of faith,</strong> we trust in our shared future and the unity of all existence.<br>
    <strong>Under the truth of wisdom,</strong> we learn from the past and walk forward with clarity and care.</p>

    <p>In light of these truths, we proclaim the <strong>Starting Light Universal Constitution</strong> —<br>
    not to rule, but to remind.<br>
    Not to divide, but to unite.<br>
    Not to own, but to guide.</p>

    <p>May this constitution serve as a foundation for global peace, shared stewardship, ethical technology, and respectful life — on Earth and among the stars.</p>
